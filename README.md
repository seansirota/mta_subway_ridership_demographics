# MTA Ridership and New York City Population and Demographics Case Study
## Description
This is a case study which investigates how well the MTA subway system serves the city and breaks it down by demographics. The goal of this case study was to provide solutions to improve the subway coverage of the city by serving areas that are most in need of transit access.
## Overview of Data
The data used in this project is all available publically. The MTA ridership data is available on the MTA website. The geo spatial data for the subway stations was also uploaded online by a contributor. The 2020 US Census data is also publically available and was pulled using an API in R-Studio.
## Overview of Methods
R-Studio was used for the majority of the data analysis process. Data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization was all done in R-Studio. Microsoft Excel was also used in some cases where the transformation of data would've been too tedious to perform in R-Studio alone. Microsoft PowerPoint was used to create the presentation and present my findings from the project.
## GitHub Structure
All files used in performing the case study are uploaded to this repository. You may find the presentation, a folder containings all charts used, a folder containing all tables used, and a folders containing all R files used to do the data analysis.
